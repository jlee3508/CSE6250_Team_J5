TO THE GRADERS:
It is recommended that the graders run the model architecture that is left uncommented for the sake of time. Other architectures may take longer than 8 minutes. Nothing needs to be changed from the file to achieve this end result.
Data was not included in this repo due to size constraints. Original data can be found in the google drive.
